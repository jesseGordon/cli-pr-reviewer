## Installation

There are several ways to install the PR Review CLI tool:

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary (Easiest)

For users who don't have Python installed or prefer a standalone executable:

```bash
# Download the appropriate binary for your OS from:
# https://github.com/jesseGordon/cli-pr-reviewer/releases

# Make it executable (macOS/Linux)
chmod +x pr-review-<your-os>

# Move it to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv pr-review-<your-os> /usr/local/bin/pr-review
# or 
mv pr-review-<your-os> ~/bin/pr-review
```

This is the simplest option as it doesn't require Python or any dependencies.

### Option 2: Pipx Installation (Recommended for Python users)

`pipx` installs the tool and its dependencies in an isolated environment, preventing conflicts with other Python projects. This is the recommended way to install Python CLI tools.

```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it
# See: https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Install pr-review
pipx install pr-review

# Or install directly from the repository
pipx install git+https://github.com/jesseGordon/cli-pr-reviewer.git
```

### Option 3: Pip Installation

You can install directly using `pip`. Using a virtual environment is recommended.

```bash
# Install directly from PyPI
pip install pr-review

# Or install from the repository (in a virtual environment)
# python -m venv .venv
# source .venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/jesseGordon/cli-pr-reviewer.git
cd cli-pr-reviewer
pip install .
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (not needed for standalone binary)
- Git
- API keys for at least one of the supported AI providers

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration hierarchy:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file (~/.pr-review.toml)
4. Default values

### Setting up your API keys

```bash
# Via environment variables
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Or via config command
pr-review config set api_keys.gemini your_api_key
pr-review config set api_keys.openai your_api_key
pr-review config set api_keys.anthropic your_api_key
```

## Usage

### Reviewing Code Changes

```bash
# Review staged changes (default)
pr-review review

# Review unstaged changes
pr-review review --unstaged

# Review specific file
pr-review review --file path/to/file.js

# Review specific commit
pr-review review --commit abc123

# Review commit range
pr-review review --commit HEAD~3..HEAD

# Limit diff size
pr-review review --max-chars 5000

# Use a different AI provider
pr-review review --provider openai

# Specify a different model
pr-review review --model gpt-4
```

### Viewing Diffs with Syntax Highlighting

```bash
# Show staged changes with syntax highlighting
pr-review diff

# Show unstaged changes
pr-review diff --unstaged

# Show specific file
pr-review diff --file path/to/file.js

# Show specific commit
pr-review diff --commit abc123

# Show commit range
pr-review diff --commit HEAD~3..HEAD

# Disable syntax highlighting
pr-review diff --no-color
```

### Managing Configuration

```bash
# List all configuration values
pr-review config list

# Get a specific config value
pr-review config get provider

# Set a configuration value
pr-review config set provider openai

# Remove a configuration value
pr-review config unset custom_setting
```

### Shell Completion

```bash
# For Bash
pr-review completion bash > ~/.pr-review-completion.bash
echo 'source ~/.pr-review-completion.bash' >> ~/.bashrc

# For Zsh
pr-review completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_pr-review
echo 'fpath+=~/.zfunc' >> ~/.zshrc

# For Fish
pr-review completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/pr-review.fish
```

## Advanced Options

### Diff Truncation

For large diffs, you can limit the size to avoid token limits in the AI models:

```bash
pr-review review --max-chars 10000
```

This will truncate the diff to 10,000 characters before sending to the AI service.

### Exit Code for CI/CD Integration

The command will automatically return exit code 1 if the review suggests changes (contains "MAKE CHANGES"). This behavior makes it easy to integrate with CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Will exit with code 1 if changes are requested (default behavior)
pr-review review

# Example in a CI workflow
pr-review review
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "PR review failed - changes requested"
  exit 1
fi
```

If you want to ignore the review result and always return a successful exit code, use the `--ignore-errors` flag:

```bash
# Always exits with code 0 regardless of review outcome
pr-review review --ignore-errors
```

This allows you to use PR Review in automated workflows to conditionally block or flag PRs that need changes.

### Syntax Highlighting

The `diff` command uses syntax highlighting to make diffs more readable:

```bash
pr-review diff
```

You can disable this with the `--no-color` flag:

```bash
pr-review diff --no-color
```

## GitHub Actions

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for automation:

### Automatic Builds

- Standalone executables for Linux and macOS are automatically built on each release tag
- The package is automatically tested on multiple Python versions across Linux, macOS, and Windows
- The package is automatically published to PyPI on each GitHub release

### Downloading Binaries

Pre-built binaries are available from:
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/jesseGordon/cli-pr-reviewer/releases

### Building Your Own Binaries

If you want to build your own binaries, you can use:

```bash
# Using the GitHub Actions workflow manually
# (Go to Actions tab in GitHub and run the "Build and Release Executables" workflow)

# Or build locally
make binary
```

See the [GitHub Actions documentation](.github/README.md) for more details.
